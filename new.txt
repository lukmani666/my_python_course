A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods)
that the objects created from the class will have.

Object:

An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is instantiated.
Objects can access attributes and methods defined in their class.
Instance:

An instance refers to a specific object created from a class. Each instance can have different attribute values.
Attribute:

Attributes are the data or properties associated with a class. They hold the state or characteristics of an object. Attributes are typically defined in the __init__ method (constructor).
Method:

A method is a function defined inside a class that operates on the attributes of the class. Methods are used to define the behaviors of an object.
